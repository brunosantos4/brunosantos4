### About Me

I am a student of Statistics and Data Science at USP (ICMC), I like to solve problems and I am passionate about Data Science.

I developed solutions for important business problems using data science. The projects present the entire pipeline for solving real problems, from Exploratory Data Analysis, through the application of Machine Learning algorithms, to the interpretation of errors and deployment of the model in production.

The details of each project can be viewed below:

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Store - Forescasting Sales - Regression ](https://github.com/brunosantos4/Rossmann-Store-Sales)
- This project uses machine learning techniques to predict sales over the next 6 weeks of a drugstore chain called Rossmann. The algorithm that had the best result was XGBoost, obtaining a MAPE of 14%. A bot was also created on the telegram that returns the sales forecast, so that managers have easy access to data

### [Blocker Fraud Company - Fraud Detection - Classification ](https://github.com/brunosantos4/blocker_fraud_company)
- This project uses machine learning techniques to classify fraud. The algorithm that obtained the best result was the Random Forest, obtaining 99.9% accuracy.
Using a sample of 1,908,786 transactions, only 14 classifications were incorrect. The company has a revenue of $ 856,775,411.85 and an expense of $ 3,266,392.96.
Thus becoming a very profitable company.
