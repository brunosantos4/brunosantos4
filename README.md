### About Me

I am a Senior Data Scientist with a strong background in statistics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Passionate about solving complex problems, I specialize in developing scalable predictive models, optimizing business processes, and deploying data solutions in production environments.

I developed solutions for important business problems using data science. The projects present the entire pipeline for solving real problems, from Exploratory Data Analysis, through the application of Machine Learning algorithms, to the interpretation of errors and deployment of the model in production.

The details of each project can be viewed below:

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Store - Forescasting Sales - Regression ](https://github.com/brunosantos4/Rossmann-Store-Sales)
- This project uses machine learning techniques to predict sales over the next 6 weeks of a drugstore chain called Rossmann. The algorithm that had the best result was XGBoost, obtaining a MAPE of 14%. A bot was also created on the telegram that returns the sales forecast, so that managers have easy access to data
  * Repository: https://github.com/brunosantos4/Rossmann-Store-Sales

  
### [Blocker Fraud Company - Fraud Detection - Classification ](https://github.com/brunosantos4/blocker_fraud_company)
- This project uses machine learning techniques to classify fraud. The algorithm that obtained the best result was the Light GBM, obtaining optimal recall and precision metrics.
  * Repository: https://github.com/brunosantos4/blocker_fraud_company

### [Credit - Classification ](https://github.com/brunosantos4/Credito)
- I classified customers between bad debtors and good debtors, so that a credit offer can be made. I used machine learning models with PyCaret and also neural networks with Keras.
